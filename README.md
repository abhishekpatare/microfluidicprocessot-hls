# microfluidicprocessot-hls
A high-level synthesis tool to perform biological or chemical protocol (assays) on top of a reconfigurable, grid structured microfluidic processor (biochip). High-level synthesis divided into two parts, module binding and operation scheduling, in this project we will develop a tool which will take care of complete high-level synthesis task.
